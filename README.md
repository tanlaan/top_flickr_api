# Flickr API Example

## Usage

This is an example of making use of the Flickr API by taking a supplied user_id, searching for photos from that user and showing them on screen. Give it a try!

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tanlaan/top_flickr_api`

2. Install the required gems: `bundle install`

3. Create a `local_env.yml` file in ./config with two key pairs, FLICKR_API_KEY and FLICKR_SHARED_SECRET
4. Start the server: `./bin/rails s`
